Lab #15 - Blind SQL injection with out-of-band interaction

Vulnerable parameter - tracking cookie

End Goal - Cause DNS lookup to burp collaborator

Collaborator link- q2tzz7bo9eqifcc6ocwfzj1rui08ox.burpcollaborator.net

Analysis:
1. We will fuzz the app with various payloads based on the SQL Injection Cheat Sheet - https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet
This just requires going into Repeater and adding the payload below right after the TrackingId.  
We've added a concat and put our payload in parens, commenting everything else out at the end.
